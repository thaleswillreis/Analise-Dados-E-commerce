# Data analysis project using Python and SQL

This project is a demonstration of analyzing a database using SQL language for queries inserted within Python codes. This database is available on the **KaggleÂ¹** website under the name **E-commerce dataset by Olist (SQLite)**

In this project, I sought to use SQL queries within Python code to simulate the use of advanced queries, to assist in the analysis of a real database, instead of using Python commands using the pandas library, as is normally done. The Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries were used to generate the graphs, while the Folium library was used to generate the heat map, containing a visual analysis of the geographic distribution of the database data.

## Technologies Used

This project was executed using Python and SQL language (data analysis). Git (code versioning), DBeaver for testing, SQLite as database technology and Debian Linux as Operating System were used.

### Required Dependencies and Versions

The software and libraries used in the projects had the following versions:

* DBeaver- Version: 23.2.5
* Debian Linux - Version: 12
* Visual Studio Code - Version: 1.91.1

**Note:** For a complete description or replication of the development environment, please use the file **"requirements.txt"**

## How to run the project (Linux)

To run the project the following method can be used:

**Step 1:**

On the project's main page [https://github.com/thaleswillreis/Analise-Dados-E-commerce.git](https://github.com/thaleswillreis/Analise-Dados-E-commerce.git), search for green button containing the name "<> Code".

**Step 2:**

Click "Download ZIP"

**Step 3:**

Unzip the folder you finished downloading.

**Step 4:**

Open the file with the .ipynb extension to view the complete code in your code editor.

**IMPORTANT:** Before accessing the code file, make sure your code editor can edit Jupyter Notebook files.


**ATTENTION:**

If you have difficulty running the project due to the lack of dependencies, start a virtual environment from the project folder and install the dependencies from the **"requirements.txt"** file using the following sequence of commands:

***Creation of a virtual environment:***

Open a terminal from the project folder:

```python
virtualenv.venv
```

```python
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When you finish using the project code, deactivate the environment:

```python
deactivate
```
